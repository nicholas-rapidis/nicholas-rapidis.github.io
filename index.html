      <h3>Academic</h3>
      <p>I am a third year physics PhD student at Stanford University working on the DM Radio experiment, a resonant dark matter detector searching for axions and hidden photons. As such, my interests primarily lie in beyond-the-standard-model physics but also in quantum metrology and cosmology. I am currently focusing on designing the third generation of DM Radio which will have sensitivity to DFSZ axions. Before becoming an experimentalist, however, I spent two quarters working on the theoretical side, specifically on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03700">the phenomenology of dark matter overdensities in astrophysical contexts</a>.</p>
      <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Physics. My research mostly focused on dark matter axion physics as I worked with Prof. Karl van Bibber and was a member of the HAYSTAC collaboration. My experimental contributions revolved around designing, fabricating, and understanding the resonant microwave cavities that are used to search for the axion. I also worked on more independent phenomenological projects. </p>

      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <p>Apart from physics, most of my other interests lie in the German and Scandinavian languages and cultures. I particularly enjoy German music from the romantic period, especially works by Richard Wagner, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, and Richard Strauss. I consider Wagner's operas to be the closest works to the Gesamtkunstwerke (complete works of art) -- a term that he himself coined to describe his goals of creating the supreme work of art. Having also taken courses in German, Middle High German, and Danish, I am  interested in the literature and epic poems of the middle ages that ultimately influenced the artists of the germanic romantic era.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy playing the piano. I had the privilege of studying with Professor <a href="http://www.viniatsopela.com/en/">Vinia Tsopela</a> for several years who heavily influenced my appreciation for music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7QR6_eXdoM">Here's</a> an (old) video of me playing two pieces by Béla Bartók.</p>
